This directory contains input files and a Python3 program to carry out analysis of
the solvent accessible surface area of specific regions within a protein. (Eq. 16)

First, use get_mean_xstal_SASA_by_peptide.py to compute reference values from the native state
simulations. All of the input data files are too large to supply, but we have provided sample
data in SASA/ for a reference trajectory (1_i1_xstal_2qcu_sasa.txt.gz) and a post-translational
dynamics trajectory (1_i45_post_trans_2qcu_sasa.txt.gz). 

Next, use get_mean_SASA_by_state.py to generate the results from Eq. 16 for each peptide and state of
interest. 

Note that msm_data.npz is obtained by running the code available at trajectory_analysis/MSM_analysis/
