This directory contains a Python2 program and sample inputs used
to extrapolate the long folding times of our 122 E. coli proteins.

The python program python_scripts/extrapolate_tf_v2.py uses the input files
of the type folding_times/1cli/*_d1_Qi_fF_alg2_3sig_3tol_pt.txt
and folding_times/1cli/*_post_trans_frames-all_conc_G.dat, which represent
the folding status of the protein according to Q and G, respectively (see Methods
and Eq. 8). To do this for the two domains and one interface of 1cli, run the commands

> python python_scripts/tf_from_double-exponential_fit_v2.py 1cli d1
> python python_scripts/tf_from_double-exponential_fit_v2.py 1cli d2
> python python_scripts/tf_from_double-exponential_fit_v2.py 1cli dom1_dom2

This will create output files in folding_times/survival_prob_ts/ and
folding_times/plots that you can view to inspect the output of the fitting.
Sample plots and time series for 1cli are provided in sample_output/

The file xstal_f2Gtot_means.out contains the mean value of the fraction of native contacts 
with a change in entanglement (G) from the static native state across reference simulations started
from the static native state. 

G time series are calculated using code available here: https://github.com/obrien-lab/topology_analysis
Mean values were then calcualted using numpy.

The file fit_results_v2.log contains the fits used to compute the
folding times reported in Figure 2C and Table S5. For example, the
value for 1cli reported in Table S5 is 2.35E19 ns. This value is
computed as the inverse of the smallest folding rate computed
from the above analysis of 1cli domain 1, domain 2, and the 1/2 interface.
The smallest folding timescale for 1cli is k1 = 4.259350376E-20 1/ns for domain 2
(check 'grep 1cli fit_results_v2.log' to prove it to yourself).
The recipricol of this value is 2.35E19 ns, the folding timescale reported in Table S5.
