This directory contains input files and a Python2 program to carry out
analysis of the structure of residues implicated in function (Eqs. 13-15). 

analysis         : contains sample output data in 1cli.bck
cntrl_files      : contains a sample .cntrl file for 1cli 
database_results : contains Database_122_16_July.txt, a database of functional residues for our 122 E. coli proteins
post_trans       : contains sample input data for 1cli
python_scripts   : contains traj_func.py

The file database_results/Database_122_16_July.txt contains the database
whose terms are described in Table S9. 

To begin computing the relative structural overlap of functional residues, run 
the command

> python python_scripts/traj_func.py cntrl_files/1cli_analysis.cntrl 1 both

This program reads in the functional residue definitions in the database file
and computes their structural overlap relative to a reference conformation (see
Eqs. 14 and 15). The output of the program is analysis/1cli/1_func_both_chi.txt

To further process this time series using Eq. 13, run the command

> python python_scripts/process_func_trajs.py 1cli both 1

The output of this command will be written to analysis/1cli/1_func_both_chi_processed.txt
It contains the processed data from the previous file. Note that three analysis modes are
available: (1) intf (interface), (2) sm (small molecule), and (3) both. These refer to the
sets of residues included in the analysis (see Methods and database file). All values in the
manuscript refer to calculations completed using the 'both' mode of analysis.  

The files xstal_func_both.dat, xstal_func_intf.dat, and xstal_func_sm.dat
contain mean values over native-state simulations (i.e., the denominator in
Eq. 13) and are used by process_func_trajs.py when generating *_processed.txt files
