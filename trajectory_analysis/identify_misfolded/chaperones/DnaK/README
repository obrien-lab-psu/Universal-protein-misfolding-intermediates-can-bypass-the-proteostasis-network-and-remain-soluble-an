The file "DnaK_clients.dat" is the list of genes taken from the supplementary information of
"DnaK functions as a central hub in the E. coli chaperone network" by Calloni, ..., Hartl 2012
Cell Reports. 

The gene names in this file were cross-referenced with the gene names in myproteins.dat to 
determine the set of our proteins that are DnaK clients. The results are stored in
myproteins_that_are_DnaK_clients.txt
