Accurate prediction of DnaK-peptide binding via homology modelling and experimental data.
PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Aug;5(8):e1000475.

The file Bukau_both_lists.dat contains all proteins from the Bukau Lab's selective ribosome profiling experiments
which were found to bind DnaK. I cross-referenced this list with the gene names of my 122 proteins and found that
73 of them are DnaK clients according to the Bukau Lab data. These proteins and their gene names are listed in 
myproteins_that_are_DnaK_clients.txt
