Contains input files and Python2 programs necessary to carry out the final cross-referencing
of protein conformations and properties to determine which trajectories are misfolded, likely to aggregate,
likely to function, etc. 

chaperones                 : contains files related to chaperone interactions
entanglement_summary_files : contains files with entanglement information for each trajectory and protein
mean_props_by_traj         : contains files with mean values of various metrics for each trajectory and protein
python_scripts             : contains Python2 functions and programs to cross-reference results
analysis                   : contains empty dumby files used to generate file names
sample_output              : contains sample output generated as described below

The program python_scripts/run_analysis.py loads the functions within python_scripts/traj_by_traj_analysis_v2.py
and uses them to cross-reference the folding, function, aggregation, degradation, and chaperone interaction properties of
trajectories to determine which remain soluble but non-functional.

The information used to classify trajectories is available in the mean_props_by_traj/ and entanglement_summary_files/
directories

Each protein has five files in mean_props_by_traj; for 1cli we have

mean_props_by_traj/1cli_cot_hydrophobic_sasa.txt  : mean value of Eq. 9 over synthesis portion of trajectory
mean_props_by_traj/1cli_hydrophobic_sasa.txt      : mean value of Eq. 10 over various chunks of time
mean_props_by_traj/1cli_DnaK_sasa.txt             : mean value of Eq. 11 over various chunks of time
mean_props_by_traj/1cli_agg_sasa.txt              : mean value of Eq. 12 over various chunks of time
mean_props_by_traj/1cli_chi_func.txt              : mean value of Eq. 13 over various chunks of time
mean_props_by_traj/1cli_Qmode.txt                 : mean value of Q mode over various chunks of time

The values in these files were produced by computing the mean over the final 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 ns
of each trajectory (or the first portion of each) for each parameter. The time series analysed to produce
the DnaK, agg, cot_hydrophobic, and hydrphobic mean properties files were generated using the methods
detailed in trajectory_analysis/sasa, Qmode analysis is described in trajectory_analysis/Q_Qmode_Qoverall,
and the functional residue analysis is detailed in trajectory_analysis/function.

The data files in entanglement_summary_files/ represents the output of Eqs. 7 for each trajectory.
These files were create by taking the discrete probability distribution of different types of entanglement change
for the nascent or mature 500, 400, 300, 200, & 100ns of the prost translational simulations 
relative to the reference distribution. 

code for the generation of the discrete distributions can be found here: https://github.com/obrien-lab/topology_analysis

To cross-reference trajectory properties and save the results to a file named run.out use the command

> python python_scripts/run_analysis.py > run.out

This will generate a set of files (like those in sample_output/) summarizing which trajectories misfold, interact
with chaperones, aggregate, degrade, are similar to the native state in terms of Q, etc. 

Many of the results presented in the main text are summarized in sample_output/run.out; for example, 
you can see that we identify a total of 1,631 misfolded trajectories and that 186 of them are predicted
to remain soluble but misfolded.

The files in sample_output/ were used to generate various plots within the manuscript:

              values were multiplied by -1 to match the sign convention in Eq. 13 such that values >0.0 indicate 
              decreased structure relative to the native state reference simulations).
