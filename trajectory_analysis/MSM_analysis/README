The programs and data in this directory correspond to the MSM results in Fig. 5. 

MSM.svg          : 2D plot of states on G and Q
MSM_sample.cntrl : cntrl file used by MSM_sample.py
MSM_sample.py    : program that carries out analysis
msm_data.npz     : numpy file containing output in zipped format
sampled_traj.dcd : sample structures
wild_G.npy       : entanglement results as numpy array
wild_QBB.npy     : fraction of natice contacts results as numpy array
wild_state_map_data.npz : output state map in zipped format

state_struct:

Each of these files corresponds to a MetaStable State. State 9 corresponds to the
native state and was omitted from the manuscript. The VMD tcl scripts allow for
visualization of the first representative structure and any entanglements.
