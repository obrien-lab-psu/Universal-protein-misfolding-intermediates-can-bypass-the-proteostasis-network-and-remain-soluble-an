Analyse simulation trajectory data to compute fraction of native contacts (Q) for each domain/interface, 
the mode of Q over a sliding window (Q_mode) and the overall fraction of native contacts
(Q_overall). 

Directories:

analysis       : directory to which analysis output will be written
charmm_scripts : directory containing CHARMM programs for binary -> ascii conversion
cntrl_files    : contains sample .cntrl file for 1cli analysis
cont_syn       : contains sample 1cli synthesis data
post_trans     : contains sample 1cli post-translational dynamics data
python_scripts : contains the python programs needed for Q, Q_mode, and Q_overall analyses
termination    : contains sample 1cli termination data

(1) To run the initial fraction of native contacts analysis, run the command

> python python_scripts/traj_analysis.py cntrl_files/1cli_analysis.cntrl 1

This will run initial Q analysis on domain 1 and 2 of 1cli as well as the interface. 
Output files will be written to analysis/1cli/1_d1_Qi.out, analysis/1cli/1_d2_Qi.out,
and analysis/1cli/1_dom1_dom2_Qi.out, respectively. Note that normally this program
takes several hours to process all of the trajectory data for a single trajectory,
but we have provided a small example that reduces the run time to <10 min. This example
consists of the final synthesis DCD file, the ejection DCD file, and the first post-
translational dynamics file.

After computing the raw fraction of native contacts, we further processed the time
series by computing the mode of Q over a 15-ns sliding window. This value within the
15-ns sliding window is compared to the average Qmode computed over native-state
reference trajectories (for convenience, we supply all of these reference values in 
xstal_stats.inp) to determine if the protein is folded in a particular window.

(2) To run Qmode analysis on 1cli trajectory 1, run the command

> python python_scripts/alg2_mode_fraction_folded_v2.py 1cli d1 Qi 1

Data will be written to analysis/1cli/1_d1_Qi_fF_alg2_3sig_3tol.txt (see program for details).

(3) To compute the overall fraction of native contacts (rather than the fraction of native
contacts for a specific structure alone) run the command

> python python_scripts/overall_Q.py cont_syn/multidom/1cli/inpfiles/1cli_chain_a_rebuilt_mini_ca.cor \ 
  cont_syn/multidom/1cli/inpfiles/1cli_chain_a_rebuilt_mini_ca.psf 345 \ 
  cont_syn/multidom/1cli/inpfiles/1cli_chain_a_rebuilt_mini_ca.psf 345 \ 
  cont_syn/multidom/1cli/inpfiles/1cli_sec_struc.txt post_trans/multidom/1cli/output/1_i1_post_trans_1cli.dcd \ 
  False analysis/1cli/1_i1_post_trans_1cli_pt.txt False True

By changing its command line arguments this program can be used to carry out diverse fraction of native contact analyses.

Data will be written to analysis/1cli/1_i1_post_trans_1cli_pt.txt

Sample output is saved in analysis/1cli.bck
