Python2 wrapper, .cntrl files, and CHARMM input files/scripts for coarse-grain protein synthesis

Directories:

charmm_scripts : CHARMM input scripts needed by cont_syn_manager.py
cmd_files      : 123 lists of commands, one for each protein (one command per trajectory)
cntrl_files    : 123 .cntrl files, one for each protein
inpfiles       : global input files for cont_syn_manager.py (e.g., ribosome structure)
multidom       : directories for 50 E. coli multi-domain proteins plus Luciferase (4g36)
python_scripts : cont_syn_manager.py Python2 program
singledom      : directories for 72 E. coli single-domain proteins

To run a synthesis command, select it from one of the 123 lists of commands in cmd_files/

> python python_scripts/cont_syn_manager.py cntrl_files/1cli.cntrl 1

Submitting one of these commands will call cont_syn_manager.py and initiate the synthesis
of a coarse-grain model from the initial residue indicated in the .cntrl file. The many 
input variables to cont_syn_manager.py are described in detail in cont_syn_manager.py's comments.

NOTE WELL: You will *certainly* need to change the path specified as charmm_exec in the .cntrl file
           to direct cont_syn_manager.py to the correct executable. Some of the larger coarse-grain
           models (e.g. 4kn7) required an executable compiled with larger than standard arrays for
           dihedral terms.

These programs are, in theory, general for any coarse-grain or all-atom model, though special care
should be taken to check behavior is as expected when using new forcefields. 

Sample outfiles written by both cont_syn_manager.py (1_synth.log) and CHARMM (1_dyna.out, 1_mini.out)
are provided for 1cli trajectory 1 in multidom/1cli/outfiles/

A sample trajectory files for 1cli trajectory 1 nascent chain length 100 are provided in 
multidom/1cli/output.bck/
