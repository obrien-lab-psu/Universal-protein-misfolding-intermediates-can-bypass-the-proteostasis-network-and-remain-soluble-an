Python2 wrapper, .cntrl files, and CHARMM input files/scripts for simulation of 
coarse-grain protein ejection from the ribosome after synthesis

Directories:

charmm_scripts : CHARMM input scripts needed by termination_manager.py
cmd_files      : 123 lists of commands, one for each protein (one command per trajectory)
cntrl_files    : 123 .cntrl files, one for each protein
inpfiles       : global input files for termination_manager.py
multidom       : directories for 50 E. coli multi-domain proteins plus Luciferase (4g36)
python_scripts : termination_manager.py Python2 program
singledom      : directories for 72 E. coli single-domain proteins
tcl_scripts    : contains the Tool Control Language program passed to VMD to merge DCD files

To run an ejection command, select it from one of the 123 lists of commands in cmd_files/

> python python_scripts/termination_manager.py cntrl_files/1cli_termination.cntrl 1

Submitting one of these commands will call termination_manager.py and initiate the ejection
of a coarse-grain model from the ribosome. The termination_manager.py program will attempt
to use Visual Molecular Dynamics to bundle DCD trajectory files for convenience. To enable
this behavior, you must update the path to your vmd executable at line 375 of termination_manager.py

The termination_manager.py expects to find the final file written by cont_syn_manager.py - for example,
1cli trajectory 1 for termination_manager.py attempts to find multidom/1cli/output/1_r345_steps131680_1cli.cor/.psf 
to use as the starting structure. The final structure of the protein after it has been ejected from the exit
tunnel is stored as multidom/1cli/output/1cli_r345_trans_term_1cli.cor/.psf.

NOTE WELL: You will *certainly* need to change the path specified at charmm_exec in the .cntrl file
           to direct termination_manager.py to the correct executable. Some of the larger coarse-grain
           models (e.g. 4kn7) required an executable compiled with larger than standard arrays for
           dihedral terms.

These programs are, in theory, general for any coarse-grain or all-atom model, though special care
should be taken to check behavior is as expected when using new forcefields. 

Sample outfiles written by both termination_manager.py (1_termi.log) and CHARMM (1_termi.out)
are provided for 1cli trajectory 1 in multidom/1cli/outfiles/

A Tool Control Language program is automatically generated and written to tcl_scripts/1cli_1_merge_termi_dcd.tcl
that uses VMD to merge DCD files into a single file for convenience

The complete set of output and input files for 1cli trajectory 1 is provided in multidom/1cli/output.bck/1_*
